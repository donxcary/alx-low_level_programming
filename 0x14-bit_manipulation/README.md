C - Bit manipulation
+// 1. Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
+// 2. Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of 0 bits it has.
+// 3. Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns 'true' if the number is a power of two, and 'false' if it is not.
+// 4. Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits its binary representation has.
+// 5. Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of leading zero bits it has.
+// 6. Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of trailing zero bits it has.
+// 7. Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of consecutive '1' bits it has.\
+// 8. Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of consecutive '0' bits it has.
+// 9. Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of bits that are the same in the binary representation of that number and the number 0.
